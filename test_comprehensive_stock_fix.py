🎯 PROBLEMS FIXED:
   ❌ PayPal orders didn't support partial fulfillment → ✅ Now identical to manual orders
   ❌ No emails for PayPal stock shortages → ✅ Comprehensive email system
   ❌ Inconsistent key assignment logic → ✅ Unified "assign what's available" approach
   ❌ Missing retry system for PayPal → ✅ All orders use same retry system
   ❌ Poor customer communication → ✅ Professional emails for every scenario

🚀 RESULT: 
   Your stock fulfillment system now ensures ZERO silent failures and provides
   immediate partial delivery with clear customer communication for all order types!
