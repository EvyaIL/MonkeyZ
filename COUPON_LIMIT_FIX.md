# Coupon Usage Limit Fix - September 1, 2025

## Issue Fixed
Fixed an issue where the checkout page was still displaying a discount for users who had exceeded their maximum allowed uses for a coupon.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. Enhanced the coupon validation API to:
   - Track and calculate per-user usage limits more accurately
   - Add explicit `userLimitExceeded` flag in the response
   - Force discount to zero when user limits are exceeded
   - Return clear error messages specific to usage limits

2. Added new helper method in the CouponService:
   - `get_user_coupon_usage`: Specifically checks if a user has exceeded their coupon usage limit
   - Enhanced `validate_and_apply_coupon` to use this check

### Frontend Changes

1. Updated the coupon handling logic in Checkout.jsx to:
   - Check the `userLimitExceeded` flag explicitly
   - Display a specific message for users who have exceeded their limits
   - Ensure discount is always set to zero when limits are exceeded
   - Improved error handling to properly reset discount on any validation error

2. Improved messaging:
   - More specific messaging about usage limits
   - Includes the user's current usage count and maximum allowed uses

## How to Test

1. Create a coupon with `maxUsagePerUser` set to a specific number (e.g., 1)
2. Apply the coupon once with a specific email address
3. Try to apply the same coupon with the same email address again
4. Verify that:
   - No discount is applied
   - A clear message explains the user has reached their limit
   - The discount shows as â‚ª0.00 in the total calculation
