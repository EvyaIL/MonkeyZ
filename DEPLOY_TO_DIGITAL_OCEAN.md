### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend env | grep -E "(MAIL|PAYPAL|MONGO)"

# Test email service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python -c "
from src.services.email_service import EmailService
import asyncio
email = EmailService()
print('Email service configured:', email is not None)
