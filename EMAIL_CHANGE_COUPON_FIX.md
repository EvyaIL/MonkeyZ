# Email Change Coupon Validation Fix

## Problem Description
When a user enters an email that doesn't exceed the max uses per user, the coupon shows a discount. However, when the user then changes to an email that HAS exceeded max uses per user, the discount still shows from the previous validation instead of being cleared and re-validated properly.

## Root Cause
The frontend was re-validating the coupon when the email changed, but it wasn't clearing the existing discount state immediately. This created a race condition where the old discount would display for up to 1 second while waiting for the new validation to complete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Email Input onChange Handler Fix
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  setEmail(e.target.value);
  
  // If coupon is already applied, re-validate with new email after delay
  if (coupon && discount > 0) {
    // ... validation logic
  }
}}
```

**After:**
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  setEmail(e.target.value);
  
  // If coupon is already applied, clear discount immediately and re-validate with new email
  if (coupon && discount > 0) {
    // Clear discount immediately to avoid showing stale discount
    setDiscount(0);
    setCouponMsg("Validating coupon with new email...");
    
    // Clear previous timer to avoid multiple API calls
    if (validateTimerRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(validateTimerRef.current);
    }
    
    // Re-validate after user stops typing
    validateTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      if (isComponentMountedRef.current && coupon) {
        handleCoupon(false);
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
}}
```

### 2. Coupon Code Input Fix
Also improved the coupon code input to clear discount when the code itself changes:

```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  setCoupon(e.target.value);
  // Clear discount and message when coupon code changes
  if (discount > 0) {
    setDiscount(0);
    setCouponMsg("");
  }
}}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Immediate State Clearing**: When email changes, discount is cleared immediately instead of waiting for re-validation
2. **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Validating coupon with new email..." message during re-validation
3. **Prevents Stale State**: Eliminates the race condition where old discount shows with new email
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same fix applied to coupon code changes for consistency

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User enters email A (valid) → discount shows
2. User changes to email B (exceeded limit) → discount still shows for 1 second
3. After 1 second → validation fails, discount disappears

### After Fix:
1. User enters email A (valid) → discount shows  
2. User changes to email B (exceeded limit) → discount disappears immediately
3. Shows "Validating coupon with new email..." message
4. After 1 second → validation completes with appropriate error message

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
node test_email_change_coupon_fix.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Start frontend development server
2. Go to checkout page
3. Enter a coupon code
4. Enter an email that hasn't exceeded max usage per user
5. Verify discount appears
6. Change email to one that has exceeded max usage per user
7. Verify discount disappears immediately and error message shows

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx` - Email and coupon input handlers
- `test_email_change_coupon_fix.js` - New test script (created)

## Impact
- Fixes confusing UX where wrong discount shows with wrong email
- Provides immediate visual feedback for email changes
- Maintains proper coupon validation logic
- No backend changes required
